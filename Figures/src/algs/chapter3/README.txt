Table 3-1: Floating-point representations

  java algs.chapter3.table1.Main
  
  The source code for the above class also contains useful documentation to
  explain more the floating point representation used in Java.
           
Table 3-2: Floating point arithmetic errors

  java.algs.chapter3.table2.Main
  
Table 3-4: Performance computations of 10,000,000 operations

  cd Code/Math
  make 
  make table
  
  The results of the table were hand-compiled by executing on multiple
  platforms.
  
Example 3-1: Sample program that allocates memory

  cd Code/Addresses
  
  find code in memory.c file
  
Table 3-5: Addresses for symbols and variables

  cd Code/Addresses
  make 
  make addressReport
  
Example 3-2: Code exhibiting infinite recursion

  cd Code/Chapter3
  
  find code in example_3_2.c
  
Example 3-3: Code with memory leak

  cd Code/Memory
  
  find code in heapbust.c but be careful not to execute this code since it 
  will ultimately consume all resources and force the machine to be rebooted.
  Make sure, for example, that you don't execute this on a shared machine!
