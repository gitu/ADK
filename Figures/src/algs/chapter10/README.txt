  Note: To see an individual set of 100 queries for the 19-queen problem,
  run the algs.chapter10.table2.SingleQuery class; note that most of the
  responses are going to be zero, but occasionally some will generate
  actual numbers. The more trials you run, the more accurate the estimate
  is going to be.
